            <h1>Chapter 6 - Constructing Design Informing Models | Feb 18th, 2016</h1>
           <a href="../chapter6.pdf">Click here to view the powerpoint and paper in PDF</a>
           <p>
            This chapter was all about envisioning scenarios of how users might use your product, or how your product functions, considering a wide variety of situations from success to failure of those interactions, letting these scenarios influence your design.  We are at the stage of analyzing or understanding user work and needs.</p>
 <p>
Some keywords for this are, Persona, barrier, scenario, story board, social model, user class, flow model, work roles, work environment model, and hierarchical task inventory. These are all things that should be considered when you are forming your models.</p>
 <p>
A work role is like your job title. So who is your user? What is the task that they are out to do? Who are they as a human being? For example if I am a web person, and my job title is Content Manager, my task is to update the information on the home page, and my user class is that I am a trained employee who knows about our personal Content Management System and I can easily navigate there. But what is not included is something like, if someones’ computer breaks, I don’t fix that. That’s not my job so I know nothing about that.</p>
 <p>
Models can also concern social situations. For example, consider a situation in which there’s a presenter, local audience, and remote audience, and they are all standing in the same area that has an ambience, work domain constraints. We observe the concerns which are the blue cloud things, and how they are creating influences. Each person has their thoughts, the main speaker is saying “ I want to communicate” which influences an event (black arrow) that says “tell me what to talk about”. And then the people in the audience are thinking “I want to learn something”, which influences them asking “tell us what you are doing, explain your diagrams”. That’s just a quick example on how creating diagrams can make you think a little deeper about how an audience might react.
            </p><p>
Hierarchical task inventories also come into play. Here we can list out all of the options that a system could provide. From this we would take our work roles, and we can make another chart that looks like the last social chart, and think, “how are these people with these qualities going to interact with this system”, what kinds of problems or barriers might they run into? Think and consider these human elements and how they would interact with your product. What do you need to change to cater to those needs?</p>
 <p>
IDEO does something very similar which they teach in their book The Field Guide to Human Centered Design. And here they are doing the same thing except taking into consideration resource flows. By observing these flows they are looking to create efficiency.

            <h1>Ex 5 Summary | February 11th, 2016</h1>
            <img src="../images/blog-5.jpg" width="800 px" height="416 px" alt="my exercise 5 interface">
           <p>
             For my ex5 I utilized three.js. Because this library is working with WebGL shapes, I decided to follow a tutorial and try to deal with that as opposed to creating something very designed. I wanted to tackle the challenge of actually understand the library first. So, I started by following the simple starter tutorial that was attached to the three.js website, making some basic shapes and just rotating them. I then looked up some tutorials online. The only one I could find that was relevant to my final project was written 4 years ago, so I spent quite a bit of time trying to get that to work, since the three.js library they were using from 4 years ago is very different from the library today. I think that this gave me really great practice and experience with the assets of the library. I broke the code down and looked at the concept, and then referred back to the current day documentation to rewrite the code. 
             </p><p>
               I think that this library is very easy and useful for creating webGL shapes, and animating them to create an immersize scene. I think that if I was using an up-to-date tutorial it would have only taken me 30 minutes to make my starfield as opposed to 5 hours i spent on it last night (Crying inside). I would rate this library a 3/5 with 5 being the most difficult. It kind of has complicated concepts in it, like the camera and positining.

            <h1>Ex4 Analysis | February 4th, 2016</h1>
            <img src="../images/blog4.jpg" width="800 px" height="370 px" alt="my exercise 4 interface">
           <p> I connected my visual interface by having the first thing the users see are uncolored white images against a grey background. It is very boring looking, but when users hover over each section, a bar of color expands from the center of each column. This bright flash of color is eye catching. From there, users can click on the headers for a small sentence describing the section. One other aspect is the "Stop talking michelle" button which will clear away all of activated toggle paragraphs.

        <h1>Ex3 Analysis | January 27th, 2016</h1>
        
        <img src="../images/blog3.gif" width="800 px" height="353 px" alt="the squarespace interface"> 
        <p> Although my design is very simple for this page, I think that it makes the user experience very obvious and easy to understand. The 4 headers on the top act as tabs, and I feel as if users would be drawn to first go to click on them. I wanted everything to fit on one page, so I utilized a 3 column grid to keep the information nice and organized. </p>

        <h1>Credit Card Form | January 18th, 2016</h1>
        
        <img src="../images/blog-post-2.jpg" width="800 px" height="327 px" alt="the squarespace interface"> 
        <p> <a href ="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects">Read Bill Derouchey's article/slideshow on Interface Design Here</a> A form that I see often is a credit card form! This one specifically is from Amazon.com I think that this form is very straight forward, as it utilizes the same formatting as a credit or debit card-- the card number on top, your eyes wandering down to the name on the card, and then moving right to view the expiration and date.  Even the image of what kind of card (visa, mastercard, discover) is kept in the same positioning to the right. It shows clear priority, clarity and purpose. The hierarchy is clear, the instructions appearing to the side and in box that shows a bit of depth, framing the portion where input is required. Everything that Derouchey brings up is used accordingly in this simple and straight to the point form. </p>

        <h1>Squarespace Interface | January 7th, 2016</h1>
        
        <img src="../images/blog-post-1.jpg" width="800 px" height="449 px" alt="the squarespace interface"> 
        <p>To manage my portfolio website I utilize squarespace. The visual design of this interface is having a box with a menu on the left, and then within the box on the right is a live updated view of your website. Markers pop up as you hover over different parts of your website, allowing you to pick from a varity of choices such as galleries, textblocks, or widgets to place into your website. I think that this interface is very visually appealing; it utilizes a lot of white space and clean typography. I think that the section of interface regarding your website editing might be a little too undefined, as you do not know exactly what areas are editable until you find the exact spot to hover over. </p>

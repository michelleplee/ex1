        <h1>Credit Card Form | January 18th, 2016</h1>

        <p> <a href ="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects">Read Bill Derouchey's article/slideshow on Interface Design Here</a> A form that I see often is a credit card form! This one specifically is from Amazon.com I think that this form is very straight forward, as it utilizes the same formatting as a credit or debit card-- the card number on top, your eyes wandering down to the name on the card, and then moving right to view the expiration and date.  Even the image of what kind of card (visa, mastercard, discover) is kept in the same positioning to the right. It shows clear priority, clarity and purpose. The hierarchy is clear, the instructions appearing to the side and in box that shows a bit of depth, framing the portion where input is required. Everything that Derouchey brings up is used accordingly in this simple and straight to the point form. </p>

        <h1>Squarespace Interface | January 7th, 2016</h1>

        <p>To manage my portfolio website I utilize squarespace. The visual design of this interface is having a box with a menu on the left, and then within the box on the right is a live updated view of your website. Markers pop up as you hover over different parts of your website, allowing you to pick from a varity of choices such as galleries, textblocks, or widgets to place into your website. I think that this interface is very visually appealing; it utilizes a lot of white space and clean typography. I think that the section of interface regarding your website editing might be a little too undefined, as you do not know exactly what areas are editable until you find the exact spot to hover over. </p>

        <h1>Squarespace Interface | January 7th, 2016</h1>

        <p>To manage my portfolio website I utilize squarespace. The visual design of this interface is having a box with a menu on the left, and then within the box on the right is a live updated view of your website. Markers pop up as you hover over different parts of your website, allowing you to pick from a varity of choices such as galleries, textblocks, or widgets to place into your website. I think that this interface is very visually appealing; it utilizes a lot of white space and clean typography. I think that the section of interface regarding your website editing might be a little too undefined, as you do not know exactly what areas are editable until you find the exact spot to hover over. </p>
